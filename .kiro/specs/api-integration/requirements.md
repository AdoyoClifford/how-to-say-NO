# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the "How to Say NO" Android app with the external API at https://naas.isalman.dev/no to fetch creative reasons for saying no. The API returns JSON responses with a "reason" field containing helpful suggestions for declining requests. This integration will enhance the app's functionality by providing users with dynamic, varied responses instead of static content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to fetch a reason for saying no from the API, so that I can get fresh and creative suggestions for declining requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests a new reason THEN the system SHALL make an HTTP GET request to https://naas.isalman.dev/no
2. WHEN the API responds successfully THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON response and extract the "reason" field
3. WHEN the API response is received THEN the system SHALL display the reason text to the user in the app interface
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle network connectivity issues gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when my connection is poor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there is no internet connection THEN the system SHALL display a "No internet connection" message
2. WHEN the API request times out THEN the system SHALL display a "Request timed out, please try again" message
3. WHEN the API returns an error status code THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a retry option to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a loading indicator while the app fetches data, so that I know the app is working and haven't lost connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates an API request THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN the API response is received successfully THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the content
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the error message
4. WHEN the loading takes more than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout the request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily request a new reason with a simple button tap, so that I can quickly get different suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a button to fetch a new reason
2. WHEN the user taps the fetch button THEN the system SHALL initiate a new API request
3. WHEN a request is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the fetch button to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
4. WHEN the request completes (success or error) THEN the system SHALL re-enable the fetch button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline by showing previously fetched reasons, so that I can still use the app without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app successfully fetches a reason THEN the system SHALL cache the reason locally
2. WHEN there is no internet connection AND cached reasons exist THEN the system SHALL display a previously cached reason
3. WHEN there is no internet connection AND no cached reasons exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL attempt to load the most recent cached reason if available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a modern and expressive design that follows Material 3 guidelines, so that I have an engaging and intuitive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL use Material 3 Expressive design components and styling
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Material 3 typography, colors, and spacing
3. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL implement Material 3 button styles and animations
4. WHEN the user interacts with the app THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate Material 3 feedback and transitions
